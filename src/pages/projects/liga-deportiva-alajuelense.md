Costa Rica Soccer Team, top 10 in CONCACAF. Custom designed website and mobile app to monetize their fan base. Ecommerce includes online merchandizing store and online game ticketâ€™s sales.

I created the User Interface for the website using Sketch and built the frontend of the site with ReactJS. In this project I did the first design version of the mobile app. It had changed a little since the first release. I built it using Proto.io.

This is a big project and we are doing improvements all the time, including the addition of new features.
