Using Agile Methodologies (AM) will result in two possible scenarios, more productive teams and faster delivery of every project or in a complete disaster. Ok, I'm exaggerating a little bit, maybe not a disaster, but It could be a lost of time and resources if everyone does not follow the rules of the game.

### What is an Agile Methodology?

It is a method utilized in software development with a particular approach to project management. It is centered around adaptive planning, project organization and short delivery times. It is flexible, fast, simple, and aims for continuing improvements. It creates opportunities to evaluate a project’s direction during the development cycle.

### How was Agile Methodology born?

Around 2001 people started to try different methods to manage software projects, they were tired about the traditional ones because they were not efficient enough, so they create the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development”. It has 4 important statements.

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
1. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
1. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
1. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### What are the different Agile Technologies that exist?

There are lots of methods including Feature-Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Crystal, The Kanban, Lean Software Development, but the most popular are Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP).

### Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP)

Scrum is a framework for efficient team collaboration on complex projects, it helps to deliver products with the best possible value. Scrum is lightweight, simple to understand and difficult to master. It can be used with other agile methodologies reaching abilities to control and manage the process in all project types.

On the other hand, if a project is constantly changing, including the requirements of the customer or when we are not sure about the functionality of the project is where Extreme Programming is very useful. In this scenario the software should be delivered in intervals everyone in three weeks.

### Pros and Cons of Agile Methodologies.

AM are so important because they create a great environment and involvement from all parties, including the team and the clients. There is transparency in the process, cause they can see all the phases and not just the final product.

Also, they help to predict delivery, cause it is based on sprints, at the same time predict costs and schedule, based on the amount of work done.

The problem with AM is that depending the projects and the company organization they are really difficult to implement, especially if the company is too big or too small.
Also AM focus almost all its effort in getting requirements for the product and not in the design itself, so the final results could be unexpected.

### My experience with Agile Methodologies.

Honestly, I have had not great experiences using this kind of methods. One of the main reasons is that the companies I have worked used to be small, with a great quantity of projects running at the same time. 
In this scenario an Agile Methodology sounds like a great idea, but it is really difficult for the team t understand the agile process without anyone focused on the implementation. So nobody follows the rules and things does not work well. Even though, I strongly believe that they are really important in software development.

### Conclusion

When Agile programming is done properly, organizations can continually find ways to increase the value to their customers. It gives more meaning to those who are actively working on the project and creates a more positive experience for the customer, producing more generous results for the company.
