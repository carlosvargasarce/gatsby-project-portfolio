Choosing a degree was a challenge for me, since I was a kid, I have always been passionate about two different fields environment and technology. When I was in high school, I did not receive a good orientation, so I started studying Management of Natural Resources at the UCR, a new career and the university was near home, so I was in my comfort zone.

A year before I finished my degree I realized I did not want to work for all my life in that area and was the reason I started to try other things, that’s how I ended up studying web development.

### Where did I study web development?

I was always good at computers and design, so I did some research and find an academy in San José called Centro Nacional de Capacitación. I took a one year course on saturdays  called Web Master. They teach with some Adobe Software, it was not like a programming course, but it was a good start for this passion I have nowadays. 

When I finished my degree at the UCR, I decide to start Web Development. For this, I chose Cenfotec cause I received some recommendations and reviews that I saw on Facebook.

### What Am I doing right now?

These days I’m still studying, if you enter in the word of programming you never stop learning, you have to study all the time and learn new technologies. I have 6 years working as a frontend web developer, doing different stuff including a lot of design. I really enjoy creating incredible UX and UI experiences for people and make them real.

There are still a lot of things I want to learn and also a lot that I need to improve, I’m looking forward to move to another country like Canada and continue getting better in this field and obtain much more experience.

This is just starting!
